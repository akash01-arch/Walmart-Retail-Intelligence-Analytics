# Walmart Inventory & Sales Intelligence Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart retail sales, inventory, demand forecasting, promotion performance, supplier risk, customer behavior, and store-level performance using **Python, SQL, and exploratory data analysis**.

The goal of this project is to solve real-world business questions that a retail analytics team would face, such as:

- Which stores generate the highest and lowest revenue?
- Which products are at risk of stockout?
- Are promotions increasing revenue or creating inventory pressure?
- Which suppliers need operational review?
- Where is demand forecasting failing?
- Which customer segments should Walmart target?

> Note: This project is created for learning and portfolio purposes using a sample Walmart-style dataset. It is not an official Walmart project.

## Business Recommendations

1. **Improve inventory planning for high-demand products**
   - Products with high actual demand and low inventory should be prioritized for immediate reorder.

2. **Reduce stockout risk in high-risk stores**
   - New York and other high-stockout locations need better inventory allocation and reorder planning.

3. **Improve demand forecasting accuracy**
   - Forecast error is too high, especially for products such as Laptop, Fridge, Camera, Tablet, and Headphones.

4. **Optimize promotional strategy**
   - Promotions increase revenue, but they also increase stockout risk. Walmart should align promotions with inventory availability.

5. **Review suppliers with high lead time and stockout cases**
   - Suppliers with repeated stockout issues and high lead times should be reviewed for reliability.

6. **Focus on Electronics category**
   - Electronics is the highest revenue-generating category and should receive stronger inventory and marketing focus.

7. **Target high-value customer segments**
   - Platinum loyalty customers and high-income customer groups should be targeted with personalized offers.
